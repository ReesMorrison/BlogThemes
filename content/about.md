Poems tell miniature stories, as do song lyrics, paintings and scenes in movies.  The stories in each art form suggest a range of cultural memes.  For example, a collection of one from each art form might make the careful viewer aware of a tangible feature such as a hat or a factory, or perhaps an abstraction such as suffering or hope.  But this notion of stories in common across art forms extends more broadly. 

All art, including the creative activities we call poetry, song-writing, painting, and filming, opens us to a multitude of themes of the human condition.  We can spot themes across art forms, and those shared themes can stimulate varied perspectives from the different genre.

That goal animates the posts on this blog: to ruminate on a shared theme from quartets made up of an Impressionist painting, a short poem in English, a rock song from the ‘60s or ‘70s, and a movie in English.   Careful consideration of the piece chosen from each genre draws out sub-themes from them.  After the four posts that concentrate on each art form in the quartet, a fifth post adds comments that span the individual observations.
