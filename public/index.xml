      <description>“Do You Believe in Magic” (Lovin’ Spoonful)
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It&amp;rsquo;s not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There&amp;rsquo;s so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?</description>

      <description>“Sophie’s Choice” (directed by Alan J. Pakula)
In a from the movie “Sophie’s Choice,” ) a Nazi officer at a concentration camp demands that a holocaust prisoner, played by Meryl Streep, decide which of the two young children at her side will live and which will be snatched away. The scene is excruciating. Everyone, especially parents, cringes &amp;ndash; no, they cry inside at the pathological cruelty of this monstrous decision forced on a mother.</description>

      <description>“The Road Not Taken” (Robert Frost)
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there</description>

      <description>At the focus spot of a well-known painting by Edgar Degas, “The Absinthe” [“L’Absinthe”], sits a full glass of absinthe. According to one summary, “Absinthe (also known as La Fée Verte or ‘the green fairy’) was a green colored, highly alcoholic spirit. Poured over ice and served with water and a cube of sugar to soften the bitter taste, it was [thought to be] highly addictive and known to cause hallucinations.</description>

      <description>“Margaritaville” (Jimmy Buffet)
Nibblin&#39; on sponge cake
Watchin&#39; the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin&#39; my six string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they&amp;rsquo;re beginnin&#39; to boil
Wastin&#39; away again in Margaritaville Searchin&#39; for my lost shaker of salt Some people claim that there&amp;rsquo;s a woman to blame But I know, it&amp;rsquo;s nobody&amp;rsquo;s fault
Don&amp;rsquo;t know the reason Stayed here all season Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo But it&amp;rsquo;s a real beauty A Mexican cutie How it got here, I haven&amp;rsquo;t a clue</description>

      <description>Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night
Over the hill between the town below
And the forsaken upland hermitage
That held as much as he should ever know
On earth again of home, paused warily.
The road was his with not a native near;
And Eben, having leisure, said aloud,
For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear:
&amp;ldquo;Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon Again, and we may not have many more;</description>

      <description>Poems tell miniature stories, as do song lyrics, paintings and scenes in movies. The stories in each art form suggest a range of cultural memes. For example, a collection of one from each art form might make the careful viewer aware of a tangible feature such as a hat or a factory, or perhaps an abstraction such as suffering or hope. But this notion of stories in common across art forms extends more broadly.</description>
