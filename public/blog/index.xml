      <description>“Margaritaville” (Jimmy Buffet)
Nibblin&#39; on sponge cake
Watchin&#39; the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin&#39; my six string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they&amp;rsquo;re beginnin&#39; to boil
Wastin&#39; away again in Margaritaville Searchin&#39; for my lost shaker of salt Some people claim that there&amp;rsquo;s a woman to blame But I know, it&amp;rsquo;s nobody&amp;rsquo;s fault
Don&amp;rsquo;t know the reason Stayed here all season Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo But it&amp;rsquo;s a real beauty A Mexican cutie How it got here, I haven&amp;rsquo;t a clue</description>

      <description>Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night
Over the hill between the town below
And the forsaken upland hermitage
That held as much as he should ever know
On earth again of home, paused warily.
The road was his with not a native near;
And Eben, having leisure, said aloud,
For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear:
&amp;ldquo;Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon Again, and we may not have many more;</description>
