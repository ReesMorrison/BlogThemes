      <description>Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night
Over the hill between the town below
And the forsaken upland hermitage
That held as much as he should ever know
On earth again of home, paused warily.

And Eben, having leisure, said aloud,
For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear:
&amp;ldquo;Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon Again, and we may not have many more;</description>
