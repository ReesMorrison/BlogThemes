      <description>“Do You Believe in Magic” (Lovin’ Spoonful)
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It&amp;rsquo;s not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There&amp;rsquo;s so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?</description>

      <description>“Margaritaville” (Jimmy Buffet)
Nibblin&#39; on sponge cake
Watchin&#39; the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin&#39; my six string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they&amp;rsquo;re beginnin&#39; to boil
Wastin&#39; away again in Margaritaville Searchin&#39; for my lost shaker of salt Some people claim that there&amp;rsquo;s a woman to blame But I know, it&amp;rsquo;s nobody&amp;rsquo;s fault
Don&amp;rsquo;t know the reason Stayed here all season Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo But it&amp;rsquo;s a real beauty A Mexican cutie How it got here, I haven&amp;rsquo;t a clue</description>
